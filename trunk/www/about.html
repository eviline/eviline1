<h1>TETREVIL</h1>

<p>TETREVIL is a variant of the well-known game Tetris&reg;.  I've followed as many of
the conventions used in official versions of the game, including but not limited to
shape coloration, rotational behavior, wall kicks, locking, etc.  The thing that
differentiates TETREVIL from other implementations of the game is that TETREVIL
uses a simple artificial intelligence to give you the most unhelpful shapes it can.</p> 

<p>TETREVIL looks (by default) three moves into the future to decide what shape
to give you.  It tests each possible landing configuration of each possible piece,
and scores the options by assuming the you will play perfectly.  It then gives you
the piece that results in the worst playing field for a perfect player.</p>

<p>TETREVIL was inspired by the unix game bastet, short for "bastard tetris".  The
two games share no code, however.  bastet is written in C while TETREVIL is written
in Java, for one.  For two, I've never bothered to look at the bastet source anyway.
The code and algorithm is completely my own creation, done in my spare time.</p>

<p>TETREVIL is open-source software, released under a BSD-style license.  Feel free
to grab it and use it elsewhere, as long as you follow the terms of the license.
If you do decide to use TETREVIL's code in your own application, please remember to
give me credit.</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>
